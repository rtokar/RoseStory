Today was the day Arya turned 16, which meant it was time for her to begin her quest to womanhood.
She had been told stories of other villagers quests to adulthood and they were magnificent. 
She hoped she would get to fight a dragon just like her older sister Luna did.
Arya excitedly got out of bed, dressed, and left with Riri, her pet lioness, to find out what where her quest would first take her. 

Arya and Riri set off towards the mountains, which loomed high over them in the distance.
Their journey started off smoothly as they traveled across the plains, but they saw clouds gathering low on the mountains' base.
They knew the clouds only meant bad news, but they were not sure what kind of trouble they should expect.
They hoped for the best, and moved swiftly into the clouds.

As the white mist gradually went away from reveal the hidden scene behind it, they saw a giant factory with a giant title "Charlie's dragon factory" on top of the front door.
Lots of dragons flying around and fighting each others with black breathing flame.
Arya felt weird that the flame leaves dark brown color when cool down, making the round sticky. 
All of a sudden, one of the dragon noticed their exist and start to attack them! 

So we tried so hard to run away from the dragons. The dragons were fast and their fire was hot and dangerous. We tired to escape from those dragons and soon, we found a cave. We went into the cave to hide.
The dragons did not find us and we were able to go back home after all the dragons left.
